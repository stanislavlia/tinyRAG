How is the former type\\nof process created? 05 0430 CH04  5/22/01  10:21 AM  Page 93', metadata={'source': 'library/pthreads.pdf', 'page': 32}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='94 Chapter 4 Threads\\nThe Linux clone system call is a generalized form of fork and pthread_create that\\nallows the caller to specify which resources are shared between the calling process andthe newly created process.Also,\\nclone requires you to specify the memory region for\\nthe execution stack that the new process will use.Although we mention clone here to\\nsatisfy the reader ’s curiosity, that system call should not ordinarily be used in programs.\\nUse fork to create new processes or pthread_create to create threads.\\n4.6 Processes Vs.Threads\\nFor some programs that benefit from concurrency, the decision whether to useprocesses or threads can be difficult. Here are some guidelines to help you decidewhich concurrency model best suits your program:\\nnAll threads in a program must run the same executable.A child process, on theother hand, may run a different executable by calling an \\nexec function.\\nnAn errant thread can harm other threads in the same process because threadsshare the same virtual memory space and other resources. For instance, a wildmemory write through an uninitialized pointer in one thread can corrupt memory visible to another thread.An errant process, on the other hand, cannot do so because each process has acopy of the program ’s memory space.', metadata={'source': 'library/pthreads.pdf', 'page': 33}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='nCopying memory for a new process adds an additional performance overheadrelative to creating a new thread. However, the copy is performed only whenthe memory is changed, so the penalty is minimal if the child process only readsmemory.\\nnThreads should be used for programs that need fine-grained parallelism. Forexample, if a problem can be broken into multiple, nearly identical tasks, threadsmay be a good choice. Processes should be used for programs that need coarserparallelism.\\nnSharing data among threads is trivial because threads share the same memory.(However, great care must be taken to avoid race conditions, as described previ-ously.) Sharing data among processes requires the use of IPC mechanisms, asdescribed in Chapter 5.This can be more cumbersome but makes multipleprocesses less likely to suffer from concurrency bugs.05 0430 CH04  5/22/01  10:21 AM  Page 94', metadata={'source': 'library/pthreads.pdf', 'page': 33})]"
